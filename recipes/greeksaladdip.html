        <h2>Description</h2> 
    </p>
    <p><strong>Greek Salad Dip</strong> is a fresh, zesty appetizer inspired by the classic flavors of the Mediterranean.
        It combines crisp cucumbers, juicy tomatoes, tangy feta cheese, and briny olives into a vibrant,
        colorful dip that’s both healthy and satisfying. The combination of textures, crunchy vegetables
        with creamy feta, makes every bite refreshing and flavorful. Perfect for parties, picnics, or as 
        a quick snack, it’s a dish that’s as
        visually appealing as it is delicious.
    </p>
    <p>This dip is easy to prepare and versatile in how you serve it. Drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice 
        and seasoned with oregano, it carries a bright, tangy taste that pairs wonderfully with pita chips, 
        crackers, or fresh vegetables. Greek Salad Dip captures the essence of Mediterranean cuisine, offering
        a simple yet elegant way to enjoy fresh ingredients with minimal effort.
